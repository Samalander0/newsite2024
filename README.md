# Sam's Portfolio Website

I built this site at the start of 2024 to showcase my work. Throughout 2024 and 2025, I've kept it updated with my more recent projects and information, but intend to rebuilt it at some point this upcoming year.

## Development

This site was created with the use of three main tools: **Svelte**; **GSAP**, an animations platform; and **SASS**, a CSS processor that allows for easier CSS.
